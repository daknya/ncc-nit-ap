    <h3>AIM</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The ‘Aims’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and continue to meet the 
        requirements expected of it in the current socio–economic scenario of the country. 
        The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook,
         the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, 
         it aims at creating
         a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in
          all walks of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose.
           Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young 
           Indians to join the armed forces.</p>

    <h3>history</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>NCC was first started in 1666 in Germany. The NCC in India was formed with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It was raised on 15 July 1948. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the ‘University Corps’, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the objective to make up the shortage of the Army. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the ‘University Corps’ was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. The UTC Officers and cadets dressed like the army. It was a significant step towards the Indianisation of armed forces. It was rechristened in the form of UOTC so the National Cadet Corps can be considered as a successor of the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC) which was established by the British Government in 1942. During World War II, the UOTC never came up to the expectations set by the British. This led to the idea that some better schemes should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace. A committee headed by Pandit H.N. Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. The National Cadet Corps Act was accepted by the Governor General and on 15 July 1948 the National Cadet Corps came into existence.
  
      In 1949, the Girls Division was raised in order to give equal opportunities to school and college going girls. The NCC was given an inter-service image in 1950 when the Air Wing was added, followed by the Naval Wing in 1952. Same year, the NCC curriculum was extended to include community development/social service activities as a part of the NCC syllabus at the behest of Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took keen interest in the growth of the NCC. Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, to meet the requirement of the Nation, the NCC training was made compulsory in 1963. In 1968, the Corps was again made voluntary.
      
      During Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 & Bangladesh-Pakistani war of 1971, NCC cadets were second line of defence. They organized camp to assist ordnance factories, supplying arms and ammunition to the front and also were used as patrol parties to capture enemy paratroopers. The NCC cadets also worked hand in hand with the Civil defenceauthorities and actively took part in rescue works and traffic control.
      
      After 1965 and 1971 wars NCC syllabus was revised. Rather than just being second line of defence, NCC syllabus laid greater stress on developing quality of leadership and officer like qualities. The military training which the NCC cadets received was reduced and greater importance was given to other areas like social service and youth management.</p>
